# BillCompare
Compare my own bill with company bill find out difference and print it out, if not different print the correct info either.The most difficult part of this subject is there are no ID to compare with,or the ID is not reliable,and aslo other key info of this case are not reliable,because the company input all the data by natural typing on cellphones.So I try to use ID Chain（that combine with 3 key info of each sides）to compare what difference between them. There are 3 kind of situation we would face to.The first is 3 keys info are exactly same or all of them are totally different,then we are sure they are same info or not,The second one is part of them are same, others are different or similar.Third one is they are all different but they are very close.
